# Asteroid MOID Regression With a DNN

The aim of this project is to use a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) between an asteroid’s orbit and Earth’s orbit with strong accuracy based primarily on other features of the asteroid, such as its diameter, absolute visual magnitude, geometric albedo, eccentricity, etc.
